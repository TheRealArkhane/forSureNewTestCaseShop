Describe:
    This is a testcase for Fittin company's Python backend junior developer vacancy
    This project represents Python Django REST realization of e-commerce shop

Project provides:
- Realizations of models: Users, Products, Categories(Tree), Carts, Orders
- Swagger API documentation by /swagger endpoint
- Basic Auth model with roles and permissions (access in my commits)
- Docker and docker-compose support (Have to add your own users, products and categories to test it with Postman in Docker)
- Tests of all basic functionality
- Added external services (DaData)

Requirements:
 - All endpoints better calling with Postman, Swagger can't provide all functionality in this realization

I hope you'll rate it well! It's my first Python Django project, and it's mostly training, the beginning of the way.
Acknowledgement is power, let's take it!!!

P.S. If you read this -> you're the best, pal! Best of luck!
